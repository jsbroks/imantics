Image Semantics's documentation!
===========================================

Image understanding is widely used in many areas like satellite imaging,
robotic technologies, sensory networks, medical and biomedical imaging,
intelligent transportation systems, etc. Recently semantic analysis has
become an active research topic aimed at resolving the gap between low level
image features and high level semantics which is a promoting approach in
image understanding.

With many image annotation semantics existing in the field of computer vision,
it can become daunting to manage. This package provides the ability to convert
and visualize many different types of annotation formats for object dectection
and localization.
